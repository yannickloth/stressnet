basic measurement stuff:
- apply 2nd order correction to clock ?
- remove outliers from clock correction computation
- add clock callibration to udp measurement
- use sum when computing locally averaged bandwidth ?

higher level stuff:
- for a switch:
  - measure difference between mac address already in mac table and new mac address
  - is lookup f(nr. of address in mac table) ?
  - is there a broadcast limitation ?

router:
- difference ipv4 - ipv6
- influence flow labels ?
- influence size(routing table)
